  Grafana 9 adds some interesting features around alerting as well as several new and improved chart types.

A sample Grafana 9 dashboard is [available in the Github repository](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-sos/tree/master/docs/grafana).

The visual appearance is quite similar to previous versions, but line charts, tables etc have been replaced with the updated variants that arrived with Grafana 9.
