## InfluxDB

Metrics retrieved from the Sense servers can be stored in an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/) database. You don't have to be an InfluxDB expert to use Butler SOS, but understanding some basic concepts are helpful.

Storing metrics in InfluxDB is not mandatory, but some kind of metrics storage - either in InfluxDB, [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) or [Prometheus](/docs/reference/available_metrics/prometheus/) - is needed to take full benefit of Butler SOS' features.

- InfluxDB is a [time series database](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-database/). This means it is super good at storing values that have a timestamp associated with them - and pretty bad at everything else. In many respects time series databases are the opposite of traditional SQL databases (who are usually pretty bad at handling time series data).
- Because of it's focus on time series data, InfluxDB v1 has its own query language, [InfluxQL](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/). It is somewhat similar to SQL, but also has many unique commands and features.
  - Influx DB v2 has a new query language called [Flux](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/query-data/get-started/). There are compatibility layers in InfluxDB v2 that allow you to use InfluxQL, meaning that existing Grafana dashboards and can be kept as they are, even if you upgrade to InfluxDB v2.
  - Flux is a more powerful query language than InfluxQL, but it also has a steeper learning curve. By learning Flux you will be able to do more advanced things with your data, for example in Grafana dashboards.
- It's worth browsing through the [InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/) to get a feel for what InfluxDB is and how it works.
  - [InfluxDB v1 documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/).
  - [InfluxDB v2 documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/).

{{< notice tip >}}
The list of metrics below shows _all_ metrics that Butler SOS can store in InfluxDB.

If you have disabled some features of Butler SOS, the associated metrics will not be stored in InfluxDB.

### InfluxDB v1 vs v2

That are some differences between InfluxDB v1 and v2 when it comes to terminology and concepts.

For example in InfluxDB v1, the main concepts are _databases_, _measurements_, _field keys_ and _tag keys_.  
In InfluxDB v2 the main concepts are _buckets_, _measurements_, _fields_ and _tags_.

The concepts are very similar, but the names are different.

The metrics below are the same for both InfluxDB v1 and v2.

## Overview

_Measurements_ are just what it sounds like: snapshots of some value(s), taken at a specific point in time.
A measurement can contain several _field keys_, which for practical purposes can be viewed as the individual metrics.

For example, the list of measurements look like this (using the InfluxDB command line client to explore the database structure):

```
> use senseops
Using database senseops
> show measurements
name: measurements
name
----
apps
butlersos_memory_usage
cache
cpu
log_event
log_event_logdb
mem
saturated
sense_server
session
user_events
user_session_details
user_session_list
user_session_summary
users
>
```

Let's take a look at what field keys the `apps` measurement contains:

```
> show field keys from apps
name: apps
fieldKey                     fieldType
--------                     ---------
active_docs                  string
active_docs_count            integer
active_docs_names            string
active_session_docs_names    string
calls                        integer
in_memory_docs               string
in_memory_docs_count         integer
in_memory_docs_names         string
in_memory_session_docs_names string
loaded_docs                  string
loaded_docs_count            integer
loaded_docs_names            string
loaded_session_docs_names    string
selections                   integer
>
```

Ok, so the field keys are the actual metrics for which we gather data. Collectively those metrics (again: _field keys_ in InfluxDB lingo) above are grouped into a _measurement_ called `apps`.

There is one more concept you need to understand: _tag keys_

It's pretty simple: Tag keys are used to categorize (or simply "tag") measurements.  
Let's say you use Butler SOS to collect data from ten Sense servers. That's great, but how will you later distinguish between server 3 and server 8? You need some way of telling your Grafana dashboard to show the data for server 3 (if that's what you want).

Tags solve this. In the Butler SOS YAML config file you can define any number of tags that will be used to tag data coming in from Qlik Sense.

The beauty of tags is that they play very nicely with Grafana - without them the Grafana dashboards would not be nearly as flexible as they are.

To see what tag keys a certain measurement has you use a query similar to the one above/for fields:

```
> show tag keys from apps
name: apps
tagKey
------
host
serverBrand
serverLocation
server_description
server_group
server_name
server_type
```

Note that this list of tags consists of two parts:

1. Tags always present. These are inserted by Butler SOS and are present for all measurements. These are `host`, `server_description` and `server_name`.
2. Tags configured in Butler SOS' config file. In the example above these are `serverBrand`, `serverLocation`, `server_group` and`server_type`.

## Measurements and fields

The measurements are grouped based on what part of Sense they are retrieved from. The groups are

1. General health metrics.
2. Metrics about userÂ sessions, for example how many sessions there are per virtual proxy.
3. Event counters: Counters for the different types of events received from Sense.
4. User events: Session and connection related messages from QSEoW logs.
5. Log events: Warning, error and fatal messages from QSEoW logs.
6. Performance log events. Events from the QIX engine. Used to monitor performance of individual charts and other app objects.
7. Messages from the log database (deprecated, will be removed during 2nd half of 2024).
8. Metric relating to Butler SOS itself (i.e. not retrieved from Sense).

## General health metrics

A shared set of tag keys are available for all general health metrics:

| Tag key            | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host               | Host name, taken from config file's `Butler-SOS.serversToMonitor.servers[].host` property. Usually a fully qualified host name, or in some cases an IP address. |
| server_name        | Human readable/friendly server name, taken from config file's `Butler-SOS.serversToMonitor.servers[].serverName` property.                                      |
| server_description | Description of the server, taken from config file's `Butler-SOS.serversToMonitor.servers[].serverDescription` property.                                         |

In addition to the above, all tags defined in the YAML config file for the servers will be included as tag keys.

## Event counters

Event counters are used to count the number of events received from Sense.

The measurement name is configured in the Butler SOS YAML config file, `Butler-SOS.qlikSenseEvents.eventCount.influxdb.measurementName`.

| Tag key    | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| event_type | Type of event. `log` or `user`.                                                                                                  |
| host       | Host name of the Sense server generating the event.                                                                              |
| source     | Source system within Sense that caused the event. Examples: `qseow-scheduler`, `qseow-proxy`, `qseow-engine`, `qseow-repository` |
| subsystem  | Subsystem where the event originated. More granular than `source`. Example: `System.Scheduler.Scheduler.Master.Task.TaskSession` |

Static tags defined in the config file, `Butler-SOS.qlikSenseEvents.eventCount.influxdb.tags`, are also added to the InfluxDB datapoints.

| Field key | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| counter   | Number of events received. |

### Unrecognized events

Unrecognized events are events that Butler SOS receives from Sense, but that do not have a valid source (`qseow-scheduler`, `qseow-proxy`, `qseow-engine`, `qseow-repository` etc).

These events will get a `event_type` of `user` or `log` based on what UDP port they arrived on.  
The `source`, `host` and `subsystem` tags will be set to `Unknown`.

## User events

User events capture real-time events in Qlik Sense as they happen.  
They originate from Sense's log4net logging framework and are forwarded from Sense to Butler SOS by means of XML log appenders in Sense.  
These events are also forwarded as MQTT messages, allowing other systems to act when warnings/errors/fatals occur in Qlik Sense.

Setup instructions [here](/docs/getting_started/setup/user-events/).

The following user events are handled by Butler SOS:

- Session start
- Session stop
- Connection open
- Connection close.

### Measurement: user_events

Tag keys present for all `user_events` records:

| Tag key       | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| event_action  | Indicates what the event is about. Examples: `Start session`, `Stop session`, `Open connection`, `Close connection`.                                    |
| host          | Host name as reported in Qlik Sense's proxy log files.                                                                                                  |
| origin        | Textual description of what caused the event. Can for example be `AppAccess`, which means a user opened or closed a browser tab with a Sense app in it. |
| userDirectory | Sense user directory of the user causing the event.                                                                                                     |
| userId        | Sense user ID for the user causing the event.                                                                                                           |
| userFull      | The combination of `userDirectory` and `userId`.                                                                                                        |

If the user event includes browser user agent information, the following tags will be present:

| Tag key               | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| uaBrowserName         | Name of connecting user's browser.          |
| uaBrowserMajorVersion | Connecting user's browser version.          |
| uaOsName              | Connecting user's operating system.         |
| uaOsVersion           | Connecting user's operating system version. |

In addition to the above tags defined in the Butler SOS config file will be added.  
More info [here](/docs/getting_started/setup/user-events/#settings-in-main-config-file).

Fields:

| Field key | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| appId     | Id of app that is opened/closed.   |
| appName   | Name of app that is opened/closed. |
| userFull  | Same as the userFull tag.          |
| userId    | Same as the userId tag.            |

## Log events

Log events are used to capture warning, error and fatal messages in Sense. Once in Butler SOS these events are stored in InfluxDB (enabling Grafana dashboards).  
These events are also forwarded as MQTT messages, allowing other systems to act when warnings/errors/fatals occur in Qlik Sense.

Setup instructions [here](/docs/getting_started/setup/log-events/).

{{< notice info >}}
There is only one measurement for log events. It's simply called `log_event`.

Different QSEoW services (Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows) will send different tags and metrics in the log events.  
Each variant is described below.

This modular approach to log events makes it possible to extend Butler SOS' with additional log events if/when needed..
{{< /notice >}}

_Note 1: Static tags are added as for all log events, as defined in the config file, `Butler-SOS.logEvents.tags`._

_Note 2: If log event categorization is enabled in the YAML config file, the categories defined there will be added as tags to the log event data points written to InfluxDB._

### Source: Proxy service

Events such as failed login attempts will be sent from the proxy service.

Proxy log events have these tags:

Descriptions of each metric/field can be found in the [Qlik Sense logging documentation](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-admin/May2024/Subsystems/DeployAdministerQSE/Content/Sense_DeployAdminister/QSEoW/Deploy_QSEoW/Server-Logging-Tracing-Log-File-Format-Additional-Fields-QixPerformance-Log.htm).

#### Rejected performance log events

For rejected performance log events, the individual events are not stored in InfluxDB.  
Instead, counters are used to keep track of how many events were rejected, broken down by a set of tags.

| Tag name      | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source`      | Name of the event. Always `qseow-qix-perf` for rejected performance log events.                                                 |
| `app_id`      | The GUID of the app that the performance data is from.                                                                          |
| `app_name`    | The name of the app that the performance data is from, if available. Blank if not.                                              |
| `method`      | The engine method that generated the performance data. `Global::GetProgress`, `GenericObject::GetLayout`, `Global::OpenApp` etc |
| `object_type` | The type of object that the performance data is about. `table`, `barchart`, `sheet`, `CurrentSelection` etc.                    |

A separate set of tags are added to the rejected performance log events.  
These tags are defined in the config file, `Butler-SOS.logEvents.enginePerformanceMonitor.trackRejectedEvents.tags`.

| Field key    | Description                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| counter      | Integer. The number of rejected performance log events.                         |
| process_time | Float. The amount of time that was needed to process the request. Milliseconds. |

## Messages from the log database

All log data written to InfluxDB share a common set of tag keys:

| Tag key            | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host               | Host name, taken from config file's `Butler-SOS.serversToMonitor.servers[].host` property. Usually a fully qualified host name, or in some cases an IP address. |
| server_name        | Human readable/friendly server name, taken from config file's `Butler-SOS.serversToMonitor.servers[].serverName` property.                                      |
| server_description | Description of the server, taken from config file's `Butler-SOS.serversToMonitor.servers[].serverDescription` property.                                         |
| log_level          | The logging level of the log event (ERROR, WARNING, INFO etc).                                                                                                  |
| source_process     | Which Sense service the log event originated in.                                                                                                                |

### Measurement: log_event_logdb

Source: More or less [log db](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-admin/November2021/Subsystems/DeployAdministerQSE/Content/Sense_DeployAdminister/QSEoW/Deploy_QSEoW/Qlik-Logging-Service.htm). A query is done to the log db in Postgres, the results are stored in InfluxDB. There is thus no Qlik API call per se.

| Field key | Type   | Description                                                    |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| message   | string | Log entry as retrieved from the Sense log database (Postgres). |

## Butler SOS metrics

### Measurement: butlersos_memory_usage

These metrics tell you how much memory Butler SOS itself uses.  
More info on these metrics and what they mean is available [here](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/node-usage/).

| Field key      | Type  | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
