## Qlik Sense + DevOps = SenseOps

Butler SenseOps Stats ("Butler SOS") is a monitoring tool for [Qlik Sense](https://www.qlik.com/us/products/qlik-sense), built with DevOps workflows in mind.

It publishes operational, close to real-time Qlik Sense Enterprise metrics to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) and [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT). From there it can be visualized using tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), New Relic or acted on by downstream systems that listen to the MQTT topics used by Butler SOS.

Butler SOS gathers operational metrics from several sources, including the [Sense healthcheck API](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/May2021/Subsystems/EngineAPI/Content/Sense_EngineAPI/GettingSystemInformation/HealthCheckStatus.htm) and [Session API](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/May2021/Subsystems/ProxyServiceAPI/Content/Sense_ProxyServiceAPI/ProxyServiceAPI-Session-Module-API.htm) and the [Sense logs](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-admin/May2024/Subsystems/DeployAdministerQSE/Content/Sense_DeployAdminister/QSEoW/Deploy_QSEoW/Server-Logging.htm).

## Do I really need a tool like this?

Let's say you are somehow involved in (or maybe even responsible for) your company's client-managed Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows (QSEoW) environment.

Let's also assume you have more than 5-10 users in your Sense environment. Maybe you even have business critical data in your Sense apps.

Given the above, the answer is almost certainly "yes" : You can simplify your workday and provide a better analytics experience to your end users by using a tool like Butler SOS.

Looking at companies using Butler SOS, they range from small companies with a single Sense server to large enterprises with dozens of Sense servers and (many!) thousands of users.

## Why a separate tool for this?

Good question.

While Qlik Sense ships with a great Operations Monitor application, it is not useful or intended for real-time operational monitoring.  
The Ops Monitor app is great for retrospective analysis of what happened in a Qlik Sense environment, but for a real-time understanding of what's going on in a Sense environment something else is needed - enter Butler SOS.

The most common way of using Butler SOS is for creating real-time dashboards based on the data in the InfluxDB or Prometheus database, showing operational metrics for a Qlik Sense Enterprise environment.

Sample screen shots of some basic [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards created using data extracted by Butler SOS:

As mentioned above, Butler SOS can also send data to [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) for use in any MQTT enabled tool or system.

## Known limitations & improvement ideas

Things can always be improved, of course. Here are some ideas on things for future versions:

- The MQTT messages are kind of basic, at least when it comes to data from the Sense logs and for detailed user sessions. In both those cases a single text string is sent to MQTT. That's fine, but assumes the downstream consumer of the MQTT message can parse the string and extract the information of interest.  
  A better approach would be to send more detailed MQTT messages. Those would be easier to consume and act upon for downstream systems, but it would on the other mean **lots** more MQTT messages being sent.
- Send data as Kafka messages. Same basic idea as for MQTT messages, but having the Sense operational data in Kafka would make it easier to process/use it in (big) data pipelines.

If you have ideas or suggestions on new features, please feel free to add them in the [Butler SOS Github project](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-sos/issues/new/choose).
