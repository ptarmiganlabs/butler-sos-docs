These settings are optional.

If you don't need the MQTT feature, just disable it and leave the default values in the config as they are.

Do note though that Butler expects the configuration properties below to exist in the config file, but will _ignore their values_ if the related features are disabled.

## What's this?

[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) is a light weight messaging protocol based on a publish-subscribe metaphor. It is widely used in Internet of Things and telecom sectors.

MQTT has features such as guaranteed delivery of messages, which makes it very useful for communicating between Sense and both up- and downstream source/destination systems.

Butler SOS can be configured to forward various metrics and events from Sense as MQTT messages. In order to do so, some shared configuration needs to be in place first. This section covers that configuration.

Specifically, a MQTT broker/gateway has to be configured. All MQTT messages from Butler SOS will be sent to this broker.

## Settings in main config file

```yaml
Butler-SOS:
  ...
  ...
  # MQTT config parameters
  mqttConfig:
    enable: false
    # Items below are mandatory if mqttConfig.enable=true
    brokerHost: <IP of MQTT broker/server>
    brokerPort: 1883
    baseTopic: butler-sos/          # Default topic used if not not otherwise specified elsewhere. Should end with /
  ...
  ...
```
