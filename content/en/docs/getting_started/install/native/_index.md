  How to install Butler SOS as a Node.js application.
---

## Selecting an OS

While Qlik Sense Enterprise is a Windows only system, Butler SOS should be able to run on any OS where Node.js is available.  
Butler SOS has been successfully used as a native Node.js app - during development and production - on Windows, Linux (Debian and Ubuntu tested) and mac OS.

| Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows                             | _Mandatory._ Butler SOS is developed with Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows (QSEoW) in mind. <br>Butler SOS is simply not intended to work with Sense Desktop or Sense cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Node.js                                                      | _Mandatory._ Butler SOS is written in Node - which is thus a firm requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| MQTT broker                                                  | _Optional._ MQTT is used for outbound pub-sub messaging. Butler SOS assumes a working MQTT broker is available, the IP of which is defined in the Butler SOS config file. [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is a great open source broker. It requires very little hardware to run, even the smallest (usually free) Amazon/Google/Microsoft/... instance is enough, if you want a dedicated MQTT server. If you don't care about the pubsub features of Butler SOS, you don't need a MQTT broker. In this case you can disable the MQTT features in the config YAML file. |
| [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) | _Use at least one of InfluxDB and Prometheus._ An open source database for real-time information, used to store metrics around Butler's own memory usage over time (if this feature is enabled).<br> At this point more metrics and events are sent to InfluxDB, compared to Prometheus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)                          | _Use at least one of InfluxDB and Prometheus._ The de-facto standard open source tool for metrics gathering in large-scale systems, including Kubernetes. A bit more complex to set up and configure compared to InfluxDB, but also more focused on providing observability features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Grafana](https://grafana.com)                               | _Optional._ The de-facto open source standard for showing real-time metrics. In order to visualise Sense real-time metrics in Grafana you must enable at least one of InfluxDB or Prometheus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
