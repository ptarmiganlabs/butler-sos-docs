# Examples

See Butler SOS in action!

::: tip Stack flexibility
The whole SenseOps ([Butler family of tools](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs), together with support tools like InfluxDB, Prometheus, Grafana etc) stack is really a platform that can be configured and used in lots of different ways.

Be curious and bold - extend the given examples and use cases with your own!
And when doing so - please consider sharing your successes (and failures..) with others, as inspiration and insight.
:::

::: warning Use latest versions
You are **strongly** recommended to use the latest version of Grafana with the latest version of Butler SOS.

That said, earlier Butler SOS versions included some nice demo dashboards too, these are still found below as a source for inspiration what can be done.
